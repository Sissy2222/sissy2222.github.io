<center><h1>Tutoring & Teaching Experience</center>
<center>As an honors geek, I have tutored and taught a broad spectrum of graduate-, college-, high school-, middle school-, homeschool students<br> 
and adult learners (face-to-face, online and in classrooms & labs), including &#946;&#946;&#946; (Tri Beta Biology Honor Society) students and members <br>
of ACS (American Chemical Society) in both the private- and university settings since 2000. </center><br>
<center>I really enjoy helping students reach their full potential and am excited about every chance to improve someone’s life by passing on my scientific <br>
insight (how stuff works) and explain the very precise language of math. This, mixed with a healthy dose of patience, drawing from a wide array of problem<br>
solving skills and the understanding that students learn in different ways, generally changes students’ attitudes towards the previously problematic subject,<br> 
reduces stress and frustration, makes it fun, builds self-esteem and more often than not, warrants further exploration on their part. <br>
I feel, this is best accomplished by using ‘down-to-earth’ attitude and language, asking leading questions and providing fertile grounds for assimilation. </center><br>
<center>When a student experiences difficulties in biology, chemistry or physics, it is often due to a lack of assimilation, disconnection between abstract <br>
concepts and real-life application. Comparing already learned and understood information to new concepts will allow the material to make sense, <br>
 which, in turn, will built a solid foundation for increasing intellectual property. </center><br>
<center>Math problems are much like puzzles, best handled by breaking them down into individual steps (making them look like old problems/concepts) and allowing <br>
students to make the connection between new and old material presented. The common threat is logic and the realization that more than one concept can be applied to <br>
 solve an equation. If you like puzzling, there is no reason you should not like math and who does not like to puzzle.</center><br>
<center>Other: besides winning at the Missouri Academy of Science, working in R&D (research and development) for a pharmaceutical company, teaching general and <br>
organic chemistry lab to undergraduates, teaching algebra at a local middle school, teaching GED classes at a local non-profit organization, working the regional <br>
 Chemathon, working with boy scouts to receive their science batch, designing lectures & labs and producing the occasional online tutorial, <br>
  I have conducted independent research, please see below. </center>

  <center><h1>Scientific Research</h1></center>
<dl>
 <center> <dt><h3>Creation of Plasmid via isolation and insertion of <br>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans upstream dsrA into pLKC480</dt></center>
 <center> <dd> upon growing the anaerobic Desulvibrio desulfuricans, the desired DNA sequence was isolated and appropriate primers were designed.<br>
Once the restriction sites, reading frames and prior gene fusions of the plasmid in question were identified, the above mentioned bacterial sequence <br>
 was inserted <font color="LimeGreen">in an effort to harvest D. desulfuricans ability to break down industrial waste, 
   while eliminating the need for a strictly anaerobic environment</font color>. </h3>
</dd></center>
  <center><h3><dt>Interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra for identification of protein structure </dt></center>
    <center> <dd> analysis and <font color="#5982e2">identification of protein structures</font color> via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</dd></center>
<center><h3><dt>Characterization of genetic structure of threatened Eastern <br>Massasauga Rattlesnake population via microsatellite DNA markers</dt></center>
<center>  <dd> working with the Missouri Department of Conservation at <font color="LimeGreen">Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge, Mound City, MO</font color>. 
  Upon visiting Squaw Creek, <br>
  learning about non-invasive snake capture and immediately applying these new skills to procure Eastern Massassauga Rattlesnakes, the drawn blood samples <br>
  were subjected to DNA work up (via microsatellite DNA markers) to determine genetic relatedness <font color="LimeGreen">in an effort to repopulate 
  the area with the threatened Massasauga Rattlesnake species</font color>. 
</dd></center>
<center><h3><dt>Determination of Best Practice to Identify Trace Metals in Lead Alloy</dt></center>
 <center> <dd>working with Johnson Control, St. Joseph, MO <font color="#FF9900">to speed up plants ability to identify problems caused by raw material
   </font color>. Determining best practices to <br>quickly and accurately identify trace metals in lead alloy 
   used to produce car batteries and <font color="#FF9900">thereby avoiding lengthy and expensive downtime of production lines</font color>.<br>
   This endeavor included the refurbishing of an older Inductively Coupled Plasma spectrometer to allow for faster identification then by initially used <br>
   Atomic Absorption and/or Atomic Emission spectroscopy.
</dd></center>
<center><h3><dt>Expression and purification of (PAM) secretory pathway proteins from <br>E. coli & utilizing these to generate polyclonal antibodies</dt></center>
 <center> <dd> to <font color="#5982e2">investigate novel neurotransmitter hormone Pedityl-glycine Alpha-amidating Monooxygenase, a transmembrane protein 
   modifying neuropeptide hormones <br>before release from the pituitary gland</font color>, E. coli was inoculated and cultures were grown. 
   Metabolism was boosted to increase synthesis of desired protein, <br>which was then isolated and purified. Isolation of serum from blood samples allowed for monoclonal antibody confirmation via Western Blot.
