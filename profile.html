Today's society is driven by innovation
and productivity. In other words, STEM 
(Science, Technology, Engineering & Math)
are more important than ever before.
Juggling school, family and social engagements
is a lot for anybody... something has to give...
and often, this something is school work 
put off until...
Sometimes, a little 'pick-me-up' is required<br>
to stay on top of your game.
I tutor/teach, in person or online, students of all ages and walks 
of life, from elementary- through high 
school & college to homeschoolers and
adult learners in 1-on-1 settings, small 
groups or classrooms.
The objectives are deeper understanding, assimilation & 
becoming a problem solver. These are key to doing well in any subject.    
Hoarding knowledge/facts without understanding 
the 'Why and How'
is like getting into your car without starting 
the engine... you're not going anywhere... fast!
		 
In fact, the only thing you've accomplished is 
adding more tension and pressure to this
already stressful situation. This will quickly
turn into a hard to escape, most vicious cycle of stress, prograstination and avoidance.
		 
Once you're stuck in this cycle, your confidence meter drops into the single digits. 
This lack of believe in your own abilities can easily cascade throughout all academic subjects, 
causing your grade point average to plummet and now the disaster is complete.

It is best to nip any rough spots in the bud as soon as they occur. 
Smart people will work on figuring things out themselves, but smart people also know, that once you
hit the proverbial brickwall, it's time to consult a subject specific expert. In this case, a professional tutor.<br><br>
My math tutoring focuses on math = logic, where does this
concept come from and how do these puzzle pieces fit together. My chemistry tutoring,
biology tutoring and physics tutoring encourages students to dissect concepts and fit everyday occurences they never
questioned into a larger picture, seeing the underlying logic of the world around us. My test prep tutoring focuses on 
specific problem areas and personalized strategic practice and test taking skills. My German tutoring & English tutoring focuses on
cultural linguistic aspects and conversation, so you can make yourself understood.

<center><h1>Tutoring & Teaching Experience</center>
<center>As an honors geek, I have tutored and taught a broad spectrum of graduate-, college-, high school-, middle school-, homeschool students<br> 
and adult learners (face-to-face, online and in classrooms & labs), including &#946;&#946;&#946; (Tri Beta Biology Honor Society) students and members <br>
of ACS (American Chemical Society) in both the private- and university settings since 2000. </center><br>
<center>I really enjoy helping students reach their full potential and am excited about every chance to improve someone’s life by passing on my scientific <br>
insight (how stuff works) and explain the very precise language of math. This, mixed with a healthy dose of patience, drawing from a wide array of problem<br>
solving skills and the understanding that students learn in different ways, generally changes students’ attitudes towards the previously problematic subject,<br> 
reduces stress and frustration, makes it fun, builds self-esteem and more often than not, warrants further exploration on their part. <br>
I feel, this is best accomplished by using ‘down-to-earth’ attitude and language, asking leading questions and providing fertile grounds for assimilation. </center><br>
<center>When a student experiences difficulties in biology, chemistry or physics, it is often due to a lack of assimilation, disconnection between abstract <br>
concepts and real-life application. Comparing already learned and understood information to new concepts will allow the material to make sense, <br>
 which, in turn, will built a solid foundation for increasing intellectual property. </center><br>
<center>Math problems are much like puzzles, best handled by breaking them down into individual steps (making them look like old problems/concepts) and allowing <br>
students to make the connection between new and old material presented. The common threat is logic and the realization that more than one concept can be applied to <br>
 solve an equation. If you like puzzling, there is no reason you should not like math and who does not like to puzzle.</center><br>
<center>Other: besides winning at the Missouri Academy of Science, working in R&D (research and development) for a pharmaceutical company, teaching general and <br>
organic chemistry lab to undergraduates, teaching algebra at a local middle school, teaching GED classes at a local non-profit organization, working the regional <br>
 Chemathon, working with boy scouts to receive their science batch, designing lectures & labs and producing the occasional online tutorial, <br>
  I have conducted independent research, please see below. </center>

  <center><h1>Scientific Research</h1></center>
<dl>
 <center> <dt><h3>Creation of Plasmid via isolation and insertion of <br>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans upstream dsrA into pLKC480</dt></center>
 <center> <dd> upon growing the anaerobic <i>Desulvibrio desulfuricans</i>, the desired DNA sequence was isolated and appropriate primers were designed.<br>
Once the restriction sites, reading frames and prior gene fusions of the plasmid in question were identified, the above mentioned bacterial sequence <br>
 was inserted <font color="LimeGreen">in an effort to harvest D. <i>desulfuricans</i> ability to break down industrial waste, 
   while eliminating the need for a strictly anaerobic environment</font color>. </h3>
</dd></center>
  <center><h3><dt>Interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra for identification of protein structure </dt></center>
    <center> <dd> analysis and <font color="#5982e2">identification of protein structures</font color> via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</dd></center>
<center><h3><dt>Characterization of genetic structure of threatened Eastern <br>Massasauga Rattlesnake population via microsatellite DNA markers</dt></center>
<center>  <dd> working with the Missouri Department of Conservation at <font color="LimeGreen">Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge, Mound City, MO</font color>. 
  Upon visiting Squaw Creek, <br>
  learning about non-invasive snake capture and immediately applying these new skills to procure Eastern Massassauga Rattlesnakes, the drawn blood samples <br>
  were subjected to DNA work up (via microsatellite DNA markers) to determine genetic relatedness <font color="LimeGreen">in an effort to repopulate 
  the area with the threatened Massasauga Rattlesnake species</font color>. 
</dd></center>
<center><h3><dt>Determination of Best Practice to Identify Trace Metals in Lead Alloy</dt></center>
 <center> <dd>working with Johnson Control, St. Joseph, MO <font color="#FF9900">to speed up plants ability to identify problems caused by raw material
   </font color>. Determining best practices to <br>quickly and accurately identify trace metals in lead alloy 
   used to produce car batteries and <font color="#FF9900">thereby avoiding lengthy and expensive downtime of production lines</font color>.<br>
   This endeavor included the refurbishing of an older Inductively Coupled Plasma spectrometer to allow for faster identification then by initially used <br>
   Atomic Absorption and/or Atomic Emission spectroscopy.
</dd></center>
<center><h3><dt>Expression and purification of (PAM) secretory pathway proteins from <br>E. coli & utilizing these to generate polyclonal antibodies</dt></center>
 <center> <dd> to <font color="#5982e2">investigate novel neurotransmitter hormone Pedityl-glycine Alpha-amidating Monooxygenase, a transmembrane protein 
   modifying neuropeptide hormones <br>before release from the pituitary gland</font color>, E. coli was inoculated and cultures were grown. 
   Metabolism was boosted to increase synthesis of desired protein, <br>which was then isolated and purified. Isolation of serum from blood samples allowed for monoclonal antibody confirmation via Western Blot.
