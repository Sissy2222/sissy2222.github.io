Algebra, derived from the Arabic word al-jabr =
the reunion of broken parts, was coined by the
Persian mathematician and astonomer Muhammad
ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (780-850), who is also
considered 'the father of modern algebra'.
Algebra, the mathmatical manipulation of setting
sides equal to one another, to balance and thereby
find the missing part, to 'reunite and make whole',
has its roots in ancient Egypt and Babylon.
Modern day applications include literally everything.
